IRC Bot
=======

* IRC bot is a program which connects to IRC as a client and appears as a user connected to an IRC channel. Difference between an actual human client and an IRC bot is that the latter provides an interactive access for a human and performs automated functions
* Currently we've included initial code for the IRC bot which responds on "Hello Mybot". More functionalities are need to be added to this bot for which we've created a TODO list.

TODO
====

* Give a sweet name to our bot :) It hates to be called as "bot"
* Automated reply for some basic messages like "help", "hello" (already done but need to improve), "logs" (need to create a logger), etc.
* Find a way to host this script so that it can run 24x7 (May not be possible to get a free service for this as the dynos sleep after some time and it may not be possible to keep it running)
* Add more to TODO list :)
